# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning  

## 📌 Overview  
This project aims to detect plant diseases using deep learning techniques. By analyzing images of plant leaves, the model can classify various diseases and help farmers take preventive measures.  

## 🚀 Features  
- 📷 Image-based plant disease detection  
- 🔬 Deep learning model (CNN) for classification  
- 📊 Accuracy analysis and evaluation metrics  
- 📁 Dataset preprocessing and augmentation  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset consists of labeled images of healthy and diseased plant leaves. It is preprocessed and augmented to improve model performance.
